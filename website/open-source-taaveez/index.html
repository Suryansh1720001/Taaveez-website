                1. Any copy of software under GPL must be under the same license. So you can't upload the app on a

                clearly state all changes, should clearly disclose full source code, should include the same license,
                and all copyrights should be retained. <br> <br>


                In simple words, You can ONLY use the source code of this app for an `Open Source` Project under `GPL
                v3.0` or later with all your source code CLEARLY DISCLOSED on any code hosting platform like GitHub,
